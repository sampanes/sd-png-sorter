# SD PNG Sorter

This is a flask application that will help you sort PNGs in a given directory (intended to be used for pngs in a Stable Diffusion output directory)

How it works is it shows you a random image from the directory and lets you rate it from 1 to 4 (1 is best 4 is worst)

You may also press enter to skip

Once sorted, there are insights to be had regarding the best prompts, worst settings, and so on, for any given ckpt

The insights part is not yet implimented but has been started elsewhere
